## SMB share enumeration with nmap -

##### Alternatively, we can use “smbclient” to list shares of the target machine.  
```python
smbclient -L \\\\10.10.119.18\\
```

##### You can recursively download the SMB share too. Submit the username and password as nothing.

###### The file also mentions that anonymous access is possible:

## NFS enumeration with rpcbind - 
Your earlier nmap port scan will have shown port 111 running the service rpcbind. This service does a specific job: it helps computers talk to each other by translating a special kind of message called a "remote procedure call" (RPC) into an address that both computers can understand. 

When a program on one computer wants to ask another program on a different computer to do something for it, it sends an RPC. Think of it like a digital request. The RPC program number is like an ID for a particular task, and the address is like the location where the task can be done.

When a program wants to offer its services to other programs, it tells rpcbind its address and the specific task it can do (RPC program number). Rpcbind keeps track of this information.

In our case, port 111 is used to access something called a "network file system." This means that computers on the network can use this port to connect to a shared storage area, kind of like a common file storage.

**Now, we're going to use Nmap again to learn more about what's available through port 111. This is like investigating further to see what exactly this network file system has to offer.**
```python
nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount 10.10.176.254
```
