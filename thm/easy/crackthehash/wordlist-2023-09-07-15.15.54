find balance in the sacrifice
ain't like you to hold back
even if it leads nowhere yeah
i won't stand by you
so i can start to begin what's begun
ticking by your call
and leave me
i find it funny that you're the only
to stand in your arms
i won't let you close enough to hurt me
i realized what i wanted wasn't there
you think we would & we do
hello from the other side other side
say that its always been me
i miss the air i miss my friends
i will feel the power
could it be the brightest star
i thought of me i want to see
when the evening shadows
to make you feel my love oh yes
its already in your eyes
dont you like me
my life had no color before i met you
trust me i've learned it
when night comes and youre on your own
just look & you will see
baby i'm calling for you
i miss you when the lights go out
i thought you loved me more than this
well its a battle that i cannot fight
look don't get me wrong
but you won't
i dont want to live in chaos
no i wont rescue you to just desert me
i can't take another defeat
sat by the river and it made me complete
but you will never give it up
and i threw us into the flames
i cant keep up cant keep up cant keep up
but every time that you text
sure shes got it all
i don't think you quite understand
so i can start to begin whats begun
i call that home
i'm trying to tell you just how
when you'll just crumble back on down
im the only one in love
ooh the people ive met
cause mine sure wont be shared
whenever im alone with you
only yesterday was the time of our lives
youre driving me away
ill be better to you
pacing floors and opening doors
do you wrong
ooh aah oh
im trying to be brave
didnt i do it right to let you down
i want to feel my heartbeat so
nothing is better
before i go
cant have you the way
i get closer you obviously prefer her
from all my tears
if it hadnt been for love
it was dark and i was over
my hands theyre strong
i promise im worth it mm
guess she gave you things
don't leave me on this stretch alone
'cause you possess powers i can't fight
i beg ill remember you say
somebody smeared
daydreamer
ill crawl home to her
every day feels like the road im on
i hope that youre well
thats what you said when you left me
running riots inside my soul
we had a date
im holdin on catch me
i'm going back to where i started
four cold walls without parole
no i won't rescue you to just desert me
where nothing ever happened
you and your charm creep closer
i promise i'm worthy 
god only knows why it's taken me
and i'm counting on you on you
so darling
and if im not the one for you
crazy for you
that i will choose i will lose
when i was a child
turn oh no no
ill always love you
cause you possess powers i cant fight
'cause i only want to be the cure
without me knowing
closer and near
when night comes and im on my own
i can't bear this time
were not the only ones
these days when i see you
cause i love you
that you are in my life
no theres nothing that i wouldnt do
the love i have for you
everything you got
i want you to be my keeper
everybody here is watching you
but theres a side to you
but now i give up
i didnt care much how long i lived
i heard that your dreams came true
so tell me when you're gonna let me in
to keep climbing climbing climbing
please stay where you are
i can't go back to the river
i'm giving you up
you're the one for me
i realized what i wanted wasnt there
all i ask is
when you're in doubt
when no one knows what its like to be us
but if by chance you're here alone
'cause it will never hurt
euna vita che cercando a te
i'd go hungry i'd go black & blue
lay me gently in the cold dark earth
is a road best left behind ahh
might just open up and swallow me whole
all my friends keep on telling me that 
it is the world to me
be in my sweats & stuff like that
but its in my roots its in my veins
you better pull me to the light
you shower me with words made of knives
rumor has it ooh
when i don't get nothing back
soaking it all up for fun
i guess were like water and a flame
looks good when he walks
she is a stranger
simply its tiring
at least i know he's lying still
theres such a difference between us
i don't regret a thing
all this sorrow & this pain
that you and i are wrong
you make me feel like i am home again
every now & then my memories ache
but at least when youre at your worst
favoritism aint my thing but
look dont get me wrong
you had my heart inside of your hand
they say to play hard you work hard
memories are fresh
what ill say is
yours too baby come on now
that tears down my walls
weve gotta let go of all of our ghosts
your body standing over me
who would have known how bittersweet
your remedy mmm hmm mmm hmm
see if i cry
i've made up my mind
go ahead & still it's not steal my heart
love you for free each other for free
when i walk in a room im invisible
in this situation ill be glad
'cause i've been here before
they dont know you like i do
the harder that i try i regress
there's so many ways to act
youre half me and youre half daddy
i'll crawl home to her
you hang on every word i say
when i'm struggling to feel at all
all that i say you always say more
no room in my bed
let it burn 
walking with each other
and that's exactly what i need to do
were in love with the world
i ain't got too much time to spare
that finally feels like home
some say ill be better without you
what if i lose my heart and fail the 
rolling in the deep
teetering on the edge of heaven & hell 
and ill tread any dangerous road
i'm holdin' on catch me
i miss you i miss you
but because of that period of time
if you don't
who regrets the things they've done
cause everybody wants something from me
found myself today singing out your name
you're the only one that i wanted
maybe baby i'm just losing my mind 
let me fall into your gravity
you played it
forgive me first love but im tired
every single thing could blow my mind
it's not my rejection
plus hes there for you
i don't know & i feel 
or will he go back to the place where
for you too dont forget me
haven't you heard the rumors
that i will be your remedy
feels like were both none the wiser ahh
yeah there's many shades of black
didn't i do it right
the one that i belong to
when you dont ooh dont
i should have known
if you don't choose to grow
the things i had planned
i wish nothing but the best for you
didn't i do it right did i let you down
ill put my hands up
so come on and give me the chance
where you belong
finally could this be it or
'cause everybody wants something from me
its like theyre scared of me
and now youve gone and changed your mind
im holdin on barely
i braved a hundred storms to leave you
i cant bear this time
like hes never felt a figure before
give me a memory i can use
id never want once from the cherry tree
if you want me to stop i'll freeze
i know you've got things to do i do too
i'm so full of love i could barely eat
you can say i chose to be alone
if youre not the one for me
mama's got a lot to learn teach me
dont you know ive fallen for you
since i thought of you
i'm just excited to get home
whether or not you're turned from it
im okay im okay yes i am
and a part of me keeps holding on
we were born & raised in a summer haze
no we aint kids no more
have i not learned anything
miles between us
at least that i'd know that you're okay
i know that youve been hurt before
before it's too late
we gather medicine for heartache
cause youre still strong
i guess she gave you things
but go on go on take it take it all you
i guess i still care
hold me like im more than just a friend
and there's many shades of black
come on and give me a chance
bring your heart ill bring my soul
ill be the one to catch myself this time
when we were younger and free
but the higher we climb
just in case it hasnt gone
every story has its scars
you make me feel like i am whole again
in a summer haze bound by the surprise
its a sickness a manic weakness yeah
but nothing will never taint us
throw your soul through every open door
you made a fool out of me
cause ive been by myself all night long
dont let go baby give me light
my baby never fret none
my dignity is become undone
whenever you look at me i wish i was her
oh honey if im not the one for you
i wont ask you you to just desert me
i dont see you
woke up feeling heavy hearted
please forgive me for my sins
for everything that ive done
you're my light you're my darkness
what is the likelihood of jumping 
and bear my soul
so come on and give me a chance
i swear to god i am such a mess
i look away i will look away
i wish nothing but the best for you too
hello it's me
i miss my mother i miss it when
theres no way i
looking back i don't regret a thing
she she aint real
filling up my heart with golden stories
you made a fool out of you
closer & near
it gathers heat without you
with eyes that make you melt
ill be somebody different
to hold in your arms
from people i dont even know
im happy and unhappy too
but at least when your at your worst
a next time would be the ending of me
'cause i want you so bad
i cant help myself from looking for you
never mind i'll find someone like you
shows that we ain't gonna take it
let time be patient you
ma ti pensavo sempre
and fly around in circles
what a thing to do
i let it fall my heart
if you need a friend or a lover
i was so scared to face my fears
inside my head
i dont want you at all
baby dont let the lights go down
ive been searching
i know it aint easy giving up your heart
over every border & on every line
i heard that youre settled down
but we do but we do but we do
you think we would and we do
baby i'm so rising
be in my sweats and stuff like that
though winds of change
you give up everything you are
i'll close my eyes then i won't see
nothin' in her room but an empty crib
and it's been that way to long
and if your mind is made up
cry your heart out cry yeah
just for you
the only regret i have
in the low lamp light i was free
but now i only soak up wine
i wish i could live a little more
bursting at the seams no doubt
you ain't seen nothing like me yet
and ill do whats right
in the light of day
you aint seen nothing like me yet
yet i dont know anybody
reaching a fever pitch
strips me down bare
didnt i do it right
fire burning and its lighting me up
you disappear one day
shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
on the rolling sea
ill do everything different
is everything really meant to change
when the world seems so cruel
hold my hand while you cut me down
and i'm gonna make your head burn
how can you not see
i dont need your honesty
cause ive been here before
cause who wants to be right as rain
and hold you tight
i will always love you
take it as it comes
but baby is that really what you want
im trying to tell you just how
haven't made
i didn't give to you
why do you steal my hand
you say it's all in my head
the other night
yes i swam dirty waters
i want you
that's what you said when you left me
how unbelievable unbelievable
come on & give me the chance
you've burnt my heart to stone
where'd you go when you stayed behind
it only makes it harder baby
mornin' will come & i'll do what's right
when night comes and i'm on my own
i'm a red hot mama but you white & cold
i quit im movin on
just hold me closly
so stand beside the river you cried
about decisions you make
is the answer to it all
that was what you told me
and if i stay i'll be alive
see how i leave with every piece of you
surely you know that im not easy to hold
if im wrong i am right
god only knows why its taken me 
you set me free oh
could have had it all
i could hold you
youre my scope everything everywhere
i say we've only known each other a year
theres so many ways to act
go at your own pace
face it all together
of a person we don't even like
there is so much space between us
havent you heard the rumors
oh that you know
oh i hope that someday i'll learn
to forget your past and simply be mine
who wants to be right as rain
and now i've had enough of love
he is a real lover
tell me to run and ill race
do tell me why you waste our time
we come from the same place
but instead i fall back to my knees
doesnt tear you apart anymore
but go on and take it take it all to you
so thats it
i'd always kiss
i'm so hard to impress
im as lost now as i was back then
painting walls with all my secret tears
say that it's always been me
baby i quit now
because im too crazy for you
hearts break & hearts wait
i didnt know quite what to do
whenever i'm alone with you
nei sogni tu con me
and not just survive
ya da hey hey hey hey
so watch them turn to dust
i know that its wrong
i'll close my eyes
you'll never know if you never try
but they dont recognize me now
theres nothing else i want
one glimpse and i panic inside
he will choose the poison over me
you're driving me away
all of my life
i hope that you're well
and there is no one there
everything i do is for you
seems i love the things you do
the heavens cried
why do you feel like that
there's a fire starting in my heart
never woulda gone to that side of town
oi i feel like you don't love me
i'm willing to take the risk
she she ain't real
will he will he still remember me
you're still not mentioning love
even in the daylight when you think that
that's when my baby found me
oooohhhh
to nurture what ive done
but i will never do you wrong
like um i feel a bit confused 
and i i i i i dont think you can save me
there's nothing else i want
that's not fair
one glimpse & i panic inside
feels like were both none the wiser
i wish nothing but the best
and who are you hiding from
the storms are raging
like i don't really know what i'm doing
baby i have no story to be told
mmh mhm mhm mhm mm
it's hard to admit that
that i will be i will be your remedy
you when you don't yeah yeah
you're gonna wish you never had met me
i know you haven't made your mind up yet
and you played it
when we were both right
i will always be there
put your hand in my hand
because you asked me to
just hold me close dont patronize
im giving you up
i can't keep up with your turning tables
as far as im concerned
don't you like me
but it dont matter it clearly
and i'm forever excusing your intentions
oh i hold you for a million years
let time be patient
i will beg & i'll steal i will borrow
i wasnt ready then im ready now
under your thumb i cant breathe
hello how are you
ive never been more scared
and making up the past
but you wont no you wont
it's been there for days on end and
and be thankful when its done
'cause then i don't see
to make me cry again
when i found a boy who loves me more
from the way you talk
you're like a dream come true
you could've had it all
i will be i will be
everybody loves the things you do
i rebut all my rebuttals
ill never say enough
you drift into my head
just take it all with my love
about what my hands & my body done
let it be known known known
i thought i told you hed be home soon
oy i'm tired
its so cold out here in your wilderness
i ain't yours for no taking
than i ever did you before
ooh ooh ooh
i know i left you speechless
if you see me coming
if im in love with you
you just want me
i'd build myself up
so why don't we go
rumor has it
fire burning & it's lighting me up
of the earth for you
on your face
ive been trying my whole life to solve
let this be our lesson in love
cause when hard work don't pay off
you must be mistaken
but we do
you know my heart more than i do
theyre moving in the dark
cry your heart out
it's no secret
i give as good as i get
two hours late
i promise im worthy 
cause then i dont see
so can i get it right now mh
you can't make your heart feel
when you don't ooh don't
watched it pour as i touched your face
you make it look like im see through
to nurture what i've done
alone and face to face
is this the place we used to love
so we can act a fool
let me photograph you in this light
oh what have i done yet again
cause you dont care hmm
whether or not youre turned from it
i don't know and i feel 
when we were younger & free
i heard his voice today
or don't you remember
it's been nearly an hour
you made me want you
feel you here forever
when we spoke yesterday
if this is aint love then what is
but you wont
when you dont
oh id do anything
just a vague and broken boy instead
i promise im worthy
i can't help myself from looking for you
when youre in doubt
let me let me just come & get it
but like everything i've ever known
there's so many shades of black
tell me you love me
hold on you just hold on just hold on
cause i knew that that was
i saw what my heart can really do
voglio che sai
but i set fire to the rain
the only thing that i want is your love
how do i feel so mighty small
and pull me to the light
what you see i see
pulls me down turns me weak for you
or should i just keep chasing pavements
we were both right
hearts break and hearts wait
even though it was so much fun
i'm the only one in love
my heart speaks in puzzle and codes
they cant look me in the eye
trust me ive learned it
i know deep down inside
before its too late
i guess we're like water and a flame
its a vision complete illusion yeah
cause i want you so bad
pull me in hold me tight
no feeling is a waste
and even then you don't get far
it feels like were oceans apart
ye thats it baby
i cant take another defeat
i wouldnt be wishing i was free
when the thunder calls for me
it only makes it harder baby harder baby
it makes me reckless
say it ain't so say it ain't so
when night comes & your all on your own
cause i knew that that was the last time
i dont think you quite understand
no grave can hold my body down
it's in my roots it's in my veins
sometimes i wake up by the door
its harder when youre on top
all you do is complain
something i can cling on to
youve been on my mind
youre still not mentioning love
theres only one way down
he cant do it on his own
then choke on words id always hide
i'll be waiting
im tired of trying
but when i call you never
i will beg and i'll steal i will borrow
let it out let it all out
you close the door
so come on & give me a chance
i had hoped youd see my face
i don't wanna be cruel or vicious
every day feels like the road i'm on
i cant help feeling
did you ever make it out of that town
whos truly satisfied
with every feeling every word
think we'll never match at all
yeah there's any shades of black
that terrific rainbow over you and me
waiting as my heart drops
i hear your words you made up
someone else
a thousand miles & poles apart
all night long
no there's nothing that i wouldn't do
it was just like a movie
wake me up wake me up when all is done
i'm movin' on
i didnt give to you
im tired of this empty house
all of these words whispered in my ear
in the end its just you
i don't want you at all
and gets me into my favorite mood
regrets & mistakes their memories made
i'll be my own savior
'round my hometown
that this would be inevitable
and boy she's bringing you down
oh my god i can't believe it
when the rain
i kept my distance so you would be free
couldnt stay away i couldnt fight it
i know id never be me
cause it was not said to you
if youre ready i am ready
shows that we aint gonna stand shit
turns me crazy
i'd go black & blue
still how can you walk away
what i'll say is
and if you have a minute why don't we go
you make me feel like i am fun again
why do i hate the idea of being free
should i give up
i would rather stay home on my own
all this sorrow and this pain
and im counting on you on you
if this ain't love then what is
im finding it hard to be here sincerely
when the day is done
sometimes it lasts in love
turning tables
he would be hard to chase
im movin on
i walked across an empty land
im so full of love i could barely eat
if i'm wrong i am right
i beg ill remember you said
i want your heaven & your ocean's too
he's willing to take the risk
soltanto una notte ancor
i feel like my life is flashing by
so come on & give me the chance
if you're ready if you're ready
i want your heaven and your oceans too
just what im hoping for
and though your hair
alright then i'm ready
i've been looking for you baby
ive been looking for you baby
as you tear your way right through me
cant say that its been that great
fire burning and it's lighting me up
itll clean your face
but you pushed me in
no one knows what its like to be us
go to the ends
here in the dark in these final hours
every time he aint here
i'm so afraid but i'm open wide
if you'd consider what we shared
water & a flame
do dily di da da da da day yeah
ill close my eyes then i wont see
you get the brunt of it all
come on & give me a chance
its been waiting for you to open up
ive seen your face under every sky
that i give in to my pretendings
ive been here before
lay down with me
it's so cold in your wilderness
for this is the end
there was just memories in a big storm
you make me feel like i am clean again
and have you tell me
bound by the surprise of our glory days
i know youve got things to do i do too
missing out the cracks in the pavement
ive known it
the crazier i turn into
you still sound like a song
just let time be patient you
why am i seeking approval
so why don't we just play pretend
this could be the end of everything
everybody wants something
you know mommy doesnt like 
but we had time against us
are the wonders of this world
and if you have a minute why dont we go
your love is useless without it
and dream about you
whatever it takes
and thats exactly what i need to do
never woulda loaded up a forty four
im so afraid but im open wide
so that's it
next time ill be braver
to earn my stripes i'd have to pay
if the lord dont forgive me
i dont care how deep or shallow yeah
when im out at a party
well i hope i learn to get over myself
so i can tell you that i was wrong
we were born & raised
and i was burnin up a fever
to make you feel my love
but i'm no good at doing it well
you say its all in my head
and i see my future in you
ill never learn if i never leap
cause heart break and hearts wait
couldve had it all
the sweetest devotion ive known
alright then im ready
out im still trying to stay inside
it turns out it aint enough
and even then you dont get far
for everything that i've done
without the security
could describe him
hear my heart burst again
boy i'm tired of trying
when i wake up im afraid 
i've never been more scared
i don't know why i'm scared
like a bomb before explosion
just in case it hasn't gone
who regrets the things theyve done
i cant love you in the dark
no i won't ask you you to just desert me
it's incomplete without you
it was dark & i was over
maybe i should leave to help you see
it matters how this ends
no one knows me like you do
turning tables yeah
the more i do the less i know
we won't be making up
it's a sickness a manic weakness yeah
shows that we are united
you played it you played it
il tempo passa senza che
you make me feel like i am young again
and boy you're bringing me down
you get the people and the government
feels like we're both none the wiser
when we used
oi i feel like you dont love me
just the guitar
all night
hello from the outside
please stop calling me it's exhausting
if this is my last night with you
thats why i dream about you
you made me tumble
then sees you through
all i do is bleed into someone else
it's the sweetest
down down down down
when night comes & i'm on my own
if you'd just let me in your life
when he shouldn't be
i'd go hungry
i begged you to let me in
all the things youd say
we feel it move through our skin
you know mommy doesn't like 
i'm holdin' on barely
'cause i love you
when we were young
no final kiss to seal anything
rumor has it rumor rumor
it's so hard to digest
think we'll never match at all but we do
they say that time's supposed to heal ya
if youd consider what we shared
without falling to your feet
i'm tired of this empty house
you dont seem
tried my best
with you and me setting the tone
this feeling won't last mm ooh ooh ooh
finally i can see you crystal clear
ooh the people ive met yeah
cause theres many shades of black

but when the pain cuts you deep
every place
i fall short each time
but we do doo doo doo doo doo ah oh

you grace me with your cold shoulder
i promise i'm worthy mm
but you cant fight fire with fire ahh

i dont have to explain myself to you
let it be known that i tried

we aint ever gonna know
i wont say a word
mornin will come and ill do whats right
that i can't adore
so that we know that it hurts

where it felt something die
and boy shes bringing you down
or dont you remember
at least i can say that i've tried
not that i care i don't care
of our glory days
the needle along the spinning wheel
its hard to hold onto who i am
you said i'm crazy
this ain't easy it's not meant to be
if you're not the one for me
hoping you're someone i used to know
theres nothing that i wouldnt do
but we do doo doo doo but we do
round my hometown
with a beating
its incomplete without you
im so hard to impress
youve burnt my heart to stone
tell me who do i run to
hitting me like an explosion
i wish i could lay down beside you
god only knows how i've cried
that i wouldn't do
they melt my heart to stone
in this situation i'll be glad
let time be patient 
now that i see
oh anymore
yeah that's it honey
it's where they make you feel powerful
and lay yourself down
cause i only want to be the cure
a most turbulent period of my life
you've been on my mind
for you & i together here
one more time
hold your breath and count to ten
i gotta go
see when hard work don't pay off
we gotta let go of all of our ghosts
hoping you'll walk through
is there anyone i could call
anyone else like i like you right
ive known it from the moment that we met
means we can break every law
oh i hope in time hope in time
please stop calling me its exhausting
like i'm the one for you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
to put the pieces of me back together
you set me free
and now you've gone & changed your mind
i'd go crawling
thats when my baby found me
don't you know i've fallen for you
are the wonders of my world
you should know i chose to be alone
to let it figure out
ovunque vai
when i was kissing on my baby
boy you give good love i wont lie
how come we've both become a version
but i've heard one on you
so that's it baby
all my life
oh simple thing where have you gone
lights go down lights go down
who wants to be riding high
when it crumbles
there's no way i
which forgive you each time
i thought i told you he'd be home soon
everything just takes me back
send me spinning closer to you
let pain be gracious
aint like you to hold back
is going to go away
'cause i need some substance in my life
in these crazy times i hope to find 
i could stay there
you know i know just how you feel
he can't do it on his own
it's like they're scared of me
'cause heart break & hearts wait
so wipe that dirty smile off
i won't say a word
i've changed my mind
but be delicate with my ego
sometimes i just feel it's only me
that terrific rainbow over you & me
so we can love each other for free
but we couldn't see eye to eye
i know this is love but
you & i have history
i set fire to the rain
i am so tired of battling with myself
we're willing to take the risk
i'll stand still & let the storm pass by
but sometimes it hurts instead yeah
he lends his coat for shelter
i won't forgive me if i gave up trying
so where you been then dont go all coy
don't forget me i begged
she made a fool out of you
'cause mine sure won't be shared
its so hard to digest
i could offer you
'cause you're all i've got left
heaven & hell were words to me
now that it's over
i'm being cruel to be kind
just give me till then
no doubt in my mind
cause we had time against us
didnt i do it right did i let you down
and the games you play
ye that's it honey
can i get it
it's harder when your on top
if this aint love then what is
nobodys perfect
i created this storm
like he's never felt a figure before
when youll just crumble back on down
i really thought the pain would pass
i didn't know a single word he said
i feel like a ghost ooh ooh ooh
favoritism ain't my thing but
do you hang on every word i say
oh they smeared it
but like everything ive ever known
id go hungry id go black and blue
you're still strong are still strong
i feel my heart begin to burst & bleed
forgive me first love but im too tired
dont forget me i beg
pave me a path to follow
you're all that i need
i came across a fallen tree
just cause you heard it
i wasn't ready then i'm ready now
favoritism ain't my thing but 
if i'm in love with you
who's truly satisfied
i know you
i can love i can love again
you & me together nothing gets better
there's nothing sweeter than my baby
about the things i can't control
at the mention of my name
i wont forgive me if i gave up trying
my heart speaks in puzzle & codes
i wouldn't be wishing i was free
i cant even cry ooh ooh ooh
i won't rise until this battle's won
let it be known that i cried for you
i can't even cry ooh ooh ooh
'cause i knew that that was
dont pretend that you dont want me
and i will always love you
if youd just let me in your life
i've been here before
boy you give good love i won't lie
i'll be better for you
even started lying to you
each & every time i turn around to leave
even thought everything's a strain
he wont go
are throwing wild and free
the love you dont feel
oh im movin on
maybe baby im just losing my mind 
all love is devout
ive forgiven it all
i need to get away to feel again
why dont you remember dont you remember
ive cried my heart out
you're my scope everything everywhere
if only if only you knew 
i've seen your face under every sky
the dream that i sell dream i sell
lord dont let me i said lord dont let me
but you played it with a beating
are throwing wild & free
about the things i cant control
please don't fall apart
talk about it somewhere only we know
let me let me just come and get it
like i know you wanna
youre the wiser one disguised from greed
i know that it's wrong
and neon lights and waiting papers
nothing that i wouldn't do
sometimes the road less traveled
see if i shed a single sorry tear
when im stumbling in the dark for a hand
cause what if i never love again
and all i can do is watch and cry
e non importa che io senta per te
just what i'm hoping for
i cant face your breaking heart
i'm happy & unhappy too
just hold on just hold on
no & thank you please madam
we almost fall apart and burn up easy
oh if only if only you knew
so thats it baby
woulda been gone like a wayward wind
but now the sky has cleared & it's blue
i'll never say enough
so i won't go i can't do it on his own
doesn't tear you apart anymore
our hearts break & hearts wait
'cause you don't care hmm
you know how the time flies
just look and you will see
or a place that you can hide
id build myself up
nothing compares no worries or cares
but you played it you played it
turn down these voices
where worlds collide and days are dark
so is it over
nothing that i wouldnt do
i get lost in our hours
on this endless game
but your not answering the phone
he won't go
but im no good at doing it well
i don't want to live in chaos
i get excitement in my bones
when night comes & i'm all on my own
ta da da da ta da da da yes i
but there's a side to you
to bring you back to me
cause i heard it screaming out your name
under haunted skies i see you ooh
of a person we dont even like
tell me to run & i'll race
now that all the dust has settled
let this be the way we remember us
the way im running with you honey
and i ain't asking for forgiveness
oh at all
oh i hope that someday ill learn
do do do do ohh ohh yeah
or would it be a waste
baby im calling for you
no one knows what it's like to be us
this was all you none of it me
i'm a red hot mama but i'm blue for you
and i'll tread any dangerous road
i love your dad 'cause he gave you to me
i'm as lost now as i was back then
no there's nothing
and the stars appear
high tides high tides high tides
i want every single piece of you
cause you feel like home
this is the end
i've been searching
heaven and hell were words to me
ive never seen the sky this color before
i love me now like i love him
i'm my own worst enemy
a girl like you aint meant to go away
yeah yeah thats it honey
like you want to like you want
'cause i can't make you love me
and on the highway of regret
i'm tired of trying
to tell you im sorry
don't let go baby give me light
its been nearly an hour
go ahead
youll never know if you never try
alone & face to face
rumor has it rumor
my heart so bad it cuts through
and you showed up
'cause when hard work don't pay off
four cold walls against my will
cause youre all ive got left
ive made up my mind
to turning tables
we were the greatest me & you
with his hands behind his back oh
and save me boy
i'd go black and blue
by choices that somebody else makes
but if i
are you crazy woman like me
oh im so mad im getting old
is blowing in your face
i could make you happy
we were the greatest me and you
youre so provocative im so conservative
i'm a fool for that
and that would make you go ay yi yi
if you refuse to activate
not that i care i dont care
but that was a million years ago
love love oh
if ive been on your mind
theres nothing sweeter than my baby
i was three days on a drunken sin
but they don't recognize me now
you cant make your heart feel
i know im not the only one
welcome sunrise with the morning glory
i aint got too much time to spare
i know that you've been hurt before
or scared of having nothing left
when i dont get nothing back
this aint easy its not meant to be
i guess we're like water & a flame
theres a fire starting in my heart
you take it all with my love
im just excited to get home
the sweetest devotion i've known
keeping me from harm
see i can see that look in your eyes
when i walk around all of the streets
i love the way your body moves
its like a ride that i want to get off
drink it all away ooh ooh ooh
but if i cant have you
if you just hold on
youre like a dream come true
aint it funny how the mighty fall
its not my rejection
even if it leads nowhere
but dont you remember dont you remember
life was a party to be thrown
if i've been on your mind
no we ain't kids no more
no i wont ask you you to just desert me
hello from the other side
every time he ain't here
ye thats it honey
but at least when you're at your worst
i still care
but lately
down the avenue
god only knows how ive cried
he said to hold my breath to sit & wait
how can one become so bounded
i woke with her walls around me
boys workin on empty
can i get it right now
well it's a battle that i cannot fight
with every feeling and every word
make your dreams come true
i'd settle for a busy tone
i was running you were walking
se non ci fossi tu
no you won't
will he still love me even when hes free
to tell you i'm sorry
youre the only one that i wanted
mamas got a lot to learn its heavy
than you ever did me before
however far away i will always love you
it's so cold out here in your wilderness
making a home down there
and i aint asking for forgiveness
per me il mondo finira
i don't have to explain myself to you
i'm hanging by a thread
cause i love
you and i have history
let it burn
if you're ready i am ready
ooh the people i've met yeah
dont patronize me
it made us restless
but i ain't done much healing
you're half me & you're half daddy
i can't love you in the dark
bring the floor up to my knees
but ive heard one on you
this aint lust
you're the only one that i want
might just open up & swallow me whole
no doubt in my mind where you belong
i won't ask you you to just desert me
because i'm too crazy for you
i cant go back to the river
have i ever asked for much
you told me you were ready
cause i cant make you love me
your gonna wish you never had met me
oh my god i cant believe it
even though everythings a strain
we could have had it all
something real something that feels true
and neon lights & waiting papers
boys workin' on empty
oh honey
you can find him sittin on your doorstep
excuse me first love but we're through
i quit now
god only knows what we're fighting for
for you and i together here
i forgive you once again
and i'll do what's right
and miles between us
when i walk in a room i'm invisible
we will stand tall
didn't i do it right to let you down
it illuminates all of my doubts
oy im tired
and put myself behind a jailhouse door
oh i'd do anything
we wont be making up
you make me feel like i am free again
and tell me no lies
you couldve had it all
love is a game for fools to play
just a vague & broken boy instead
and the whole world is on your case
your mind up yet
ill be waiting
i've never known this never before
listen i know how low i can go
wish that i would let you break my walls
i find it funny that youre the only
of when we were young
hey hey hey hey
oh i'm movin' on
towards me from across the room
now you're gone
you know i'll always mean
i only wanted to have fun
you say ive known you longer my dear
but i want to have fun
but you'd save the best for last
nobody knows it better than me
hold me closer one more time
trying to learn to lean in to it all
look up to the sky not just the floor
it drags as i lose my mind
now i'm resemblance to the man i met
its a quick turn
youre the one for me
theres never been a better time
you ain't seen nothing
collecting silver coil
you will only be eternally
and it's teasing me
to go over everything
it's about time that i face myself
i let my heart decide the way
sat by the river & it made me complete
i get excitement in your bones
i know it's hard but it's not
to whisper will you leave your man 
to forget your past & simply be mine
you made me leave you
i'm okay i'm okay yes i am
and everything you do's a game
like im the one for you
that love is a game for fools to play
even though everything's a strain
you & your charm creep closer
forgive me first love but i'm too tired
simply it's tiring
if this is ain't love then what is
but i wont go i cant do it on my own
i'm happy and unhappy too
i dont regret a thing
she is half your age
love will soon come
but my knees were far too weak
sometimes the hole you left hurts
every feeling every word
i need a drink to get me out
hoping youre someone i used to know
dont try to change my mind
let the sky fall
some say i'll be better without you
and i swear you moved overseas
its where they make you feel powerful
i will lay down my heart
cause when hard work dont pay off
i heard that you're settled down
put myself behind a jailhouse door
lay down with me tell me no lies
so where you been then don't go all coy
whichever road i choose you'll go
seven days has gone so fast
dont forget me i begged
it was just like a song
that i cant adore
we both know we aint kids no more
baby i quit
we were sad of getting old
cause i need some substance in my life
that you & i are wrong
you played it to the beat
deep down i must have always known
but as time goes on & my age gets older
i feel very paranoid feel very stressed
and everyone agrees
ive drowned and dreamt this moment
turned my sorrow into treasured gold
if you dont
but i won't go
i often think about where i went wrong
people say crazy things
looking back i dont regret a thing
we were born and raised in a summer haze
cause my babys sweet as can be
it feels like we're oceans apart
i won't go i can't do it on my own
maybe you'll see
somewhere only we know
the way i want you
oh so i hope i learn to get over myself
the one that shoots me each & every time
regrets & mistakes they're memories made
can i have a moment
you think we would & we do 
but you played it
i didn't know quite what to do
put a kiss on top of your head
when i was young
at least i know hes lying still
that's why i dream about you
everybody taking different sides
i beg i'll remember you said
that i wouldnt do
under haunted skies i see you
if you want me to stop ill freeze
sitting on the sea
from people i don't even know
at least i can say that ive tried
like how
they're moving in the dark
well it felt something died
there's nothing that i wouldn't do
when he shouldnt be
i've been trying my whole life to solve
i'll never learn if i never leap
theres never been a better place
it's a sacrifice but i can't live a lie
im being cruel to be kind
we could've had it all
'cause we had time against us
but i aint done much healing
don't need to look no further
the love you don't feel
usually im best alone
and now ive had enough of love
baby don't let the lights go down
can i get it right now can i get it
feels like we're both none the wiser ahh
theyve all been said before you know
if you dont choose to grow
it's already in your eyes
all the things you'd say
i said lord don't let me let me down
can't have you the way
youre the right kind of madness
you make it look like i'm see through
you said im crazy
never mind ill find someone like you
until you kissed my lips & you saved me
so why dont we go
the last time
and boy youre bringing me down
i promise i'm worth it
i will beg and ill steal i will borrow
but that's your projection
i wont go i cant do it on my own
hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
are the wonders of now
how can i help lift you
turn my sorrow into treasured gold
time against us
it turns out it ain't enough
turn down the bed
never woulda seen the trouble that im in
lose myself in time
tell me to run and i'll race
cause there's many shades of black
just take it take it all with you
i know you havent made your mind up yet
with your loving there aint nothing
this ain't lust
its the sweetest
id always kiss
but go on & take it take it all to you
where worlds collide & days are dark
did i let you down
it'll clean your face
didn't i give it all
'cause we are living worlds apart
and she put her love down soft & sweet
if youve got someone else
dont patronize
to earn my stripes id have to pay
but it's in my roots it's in my veins
but not if you are so reckless
why would i put that on you
dont leave me on this stretch alone
and have you tell me 
but go on & take it take it all with you
and im forever excusing your intentions
the night
what have i done
youre the only one that i want
i promise i'm worthy
that i will be i will be your remedy oh
this feeling wont last mm ooh ooh ooh
when will i begin to feel like me again
treat her better
you know how to feel things
i mustve called a thousand times
it's hard to hold onto who i am
i never woulda hitch hiked to birmingham
but good to catch
let pain be gracious 
i know its hard but its not
if i am im crazy for you
i remember you said
shows that we aint gonna take it
for you too don't forget me
and if i'm not the one for you
with your loving there ain't nothing
water and a flame
out of my life & into your arms
then choke on words i'd always hide
under your thumb i can't breathe
if you got someone else
im a red hot mama but you white and cold
send my love to your new lover
tell a story that i cannot bear to hear
a girl like you ain't meant to go away
sometimes i just feel its only me
no and thank you please madam
yes i do and always loved you
but we do but we do but we do but we do
just be gracious
your name
brushing past my every groove
ill be my own savior
and the more i do the less i know
cause this is trouble but it feels right
i can't face your breaking heart
watch you wave
then our eyes cry and souls sigh
and it is key
that we met
youre all that i need
but sometimes it hurts instead
ooh the people ive met yea
and dream next to you
then our eyes cry & souls sigh
there is something in your loving
you and me together
they make believe that everything
you when you dont yeah yeah
we almost fall apart & burn up easy
and he could change the world
without one dollar to my name
oh yea a a oh oh oh oh oh
that we might be exactly like we were
dont need to think it over
even thought everythings a strain
but you won't no you won't
don't look back at this crumbling fool
and as it fell you rose to claim it
its better when something is wrong
pacing floors & opening doors
i won't make the same mistake again
making memories using my eyes
morning will come
a million years ago
cause i knew that that was 
but you're cold to the core
just thinking of your face
you still look like a movie
oh oh oh oh
of my world yeah
the sight of you is dramatic
go on go on & take it take it all to you
i've known it
could've had it all
and without your love i'm hollow yeah
that's it
doo yeah yea a a oh oh oh oh oh ooh
go ahead and still my heart
is there anything i can do for you dear
this love has dried up and stayed behind
think well never match at all but we do
and for what & for what & for what
and hope that you find the missing piece
but now the sky has cleared and its blue
we've both know we ain't kids no more
thats it
dont come any closer
mamas got a lot to learn teach me
i wish you'd come over
please dont fall apart
cause it will never hurt
usually i'm best alone
and i will give up this fight
i never woulda loaded up a forty four
i swear im dead in the eyes ooh ooh ooh
you aint seen nothing
there's such a difference between us
for the big one for the big jump
the bodies lying in the sand
swept away im stolen
right now i truly hate being me
ive drowned & dreamt this moment
thats not fair
'cause heart break and hearts wait
in hope that you find the missing piece
so long to let my doubts go
a jaw dropper
i've cried my heart out
the scars of your love remind me of us
to the beat
when night comes and i'm all on my own
throw me to the water yeah yeah
over every border and on every line
my hands they're strong
we both know we ain't kids no more
and theres many shades of black
and watched you wave
are you crazy
this is how the story went
i aint lost just wandering
but oh my oh my
it was in the darkest of my days
so who want to be right as rain
with every feeling & every word
you look like a movie
nothin in her room but an empty crib
this love has dried up & stayed behind
i can't help feeling
hold your breath & count to ten
baby please remember me once more
standing there
they say that times supposed to heal ya
but i wont go
turn down the lights
you get excitement in your bones
maybe we're already defeated
reminded by things i find
you & me together
they've all been said before you know
weve both know we aint kids no more
if you've got someone else
i know i'm not the only one
so i hope i learn to get over myself
i'll be better to you
even though my hands are tied
no one has me like you do baby
turning oh
you don't seem
i saw a boy that looked like you
to the way you move
sure she's got it all
so hello from the other side other side
i feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
walking with each other 
complacency is the worst trait to have
old friend why are you so shy
didnt i give it all
painting pictures with my mind
when i lay with you
just how good for you i am
i know there is no tomorrow
i promise you will see
for someone like you
nobody told me that youd be here
give me a reason to stay
it is happening again
heavens cried
i'd never want once from the cherry tree
i heard youve been missing me
don't need to think it over
id do it all again like i did it
is on your case
if you just hold on mm
i wont stand by you
to dry your tears
you said i'm stubborn & i never give in
theres so many shades of black
i'll do everything different
if your worry bound
their lipstick
in the end it's just you
the life that you truly want
i wanna step into your great unknown
its calling me home its calling me home
when the rain is blowing in your face
never woulda hitch hiked to birmingham
say what's on your mind
there's only one way down
cause theres a side to you
but if i can't have you
im hanging by a thread
when i'm out at a party
fool that i am
close enough to start a war
its harder when your on top
cause i found a boy who i love more
all that i have is on the floor
hello its me
ooh the people i've met yea
i don't need your honesty
just hold hold on
just 'cause you heard it
every now and then my memories ache
the sweetest devotion
standing on my own two feet
and i'm sure my eyes they speak for me
i said lord dont let me let me down
were willing to take the risk
yeah yeah that's it honey
you get the people & the government
out of my life and into your arms
all i want is for you to be mine
and be thankful when it's done
build your world around me
you just hold on
when love is a game for fools to play
so close yet still far away
the storms are raging on the rolling sea
maybe youll see
yeah yeah hey ay
go ahead & still my heart
who you have on your hands
but i just feel really lonely
turn down these voices inside my head
stop drowning in wait
boy im tired of trying
but you can't fight fire with fire ahh
when night comes and im all on my own
or at least as far as i thought i knew
well it burned while i cried
where i grew up & found my feet
thats why you feel so insecure
and for what and for what and for what
love will soon come baby
dont look back at this crumbling fool
we play so dirty in the dark
i just think about my baby
i felt the earth beneath my feet
i say weve only known each other a year
ive changed my mind
go to the ends of this earth for you
just how good this could be
don't pretend that you don't want me
i swear i'm dead in the eyes ooh ooh ooh
as far as i'm concerned
but thats your projection
chiamami amor
to say goodnight
and i hear your words that i made up
when was the last time you thought of me
that i will be i will be i will be
out of all the people in the world
and if i stay ill be alive
ive never known this never before
and you played it to the beat
but we couldnt see eye to eye
regrets and mistakes their memories made
mama's got a lot to learn it's heavy
i hoped you'd see my face
waits for you
i grow fonder every day
you are still strong
you know i you know i'm gonna do it
lord have mercy on my soul
where love is lost your ghost is found
no theres nothing
i'm finding it hard to be here sincerely
i try to think of things to say
but not in this way
every word ive said
everybody wants something from me
when youre holding me
but youre cold to the core
the way i'm running with you honey
to when you were there
its a sacrifice but i cant live a lie
your teasing ain't enough
we're not the only ones
in every face that ive ever known
and all i can do is watch & cry
to scratch my itch and beat my drum
when i fell off your mind
excuse me first love but were through
i quit i'm movin' on
im willing to take the risk
close my eyes
ill always yearn if i never speak
take your eyes off of me so i can leave
stop asking me to stay
i didnt know a single word he said
i promise im worth it
never mind said your open arms
where i grew up and found my feet
devotion
all of my life ive been frozen
i heard you've been missing me
feel the earth move & then
oh i'm so mad i'm getting old
hello from the outside outside
but youd save the best for last
if it hadn't been for love
before we realized
everybody sees
why should anything about it be fair
filling rooms with all my hopes & fears
and everything you dos a game
when you're holding me
don't come any closer
when you don't
i hoped youd see my face
im a red hot mama but im blue for you
it is so quick to let us
will i ever get there
that's why you feel so insecure
yeah theres many shades of black
'cause you feel like home
so just hold on ooh ooh
and turning my heel & strutting my feet
there is no simple
it's harder when you're on top
hoping youll walk through
but it's you who makes me lose my head
god only knows why its taken me
oh honey if i'm not the one for you
it's better when something is wrong
i have nothing to feel no more
i had hoped you'd see my face
sweetest
i look away i look away
plus he's there for you
yet i don't know anybody
i don't see you
they can't look me in the eye
but give it to yourself now
god only knows what were fighting for
couldn't stay away i couldn't fight it
i was so young that it was hard to know
soaking up the sun
are running out of time
i promise i'm worth it mm
of my world
ooh ooh ooh ooh
id go crawling
we're in love with the world
'cause you're still strong
i met someone by accident
but the more i do
and i'd go crawling down the avenue
i want to be lost in you
ain't it funny how the mighty fall
like me yet
'cause i love
they were never true never true
sooth me so
i'm trying to be brave
i could offer you a warm embrace
ill close my eyes
when you dont yeah
i'll put my hands up
youre still strong are still strong
you had my heart inside of your hands
'cause he won't go
and turn me into a crumbling fool
when the night keeps you from sleeping
a woman like me
we couldve had it all
can i get it right now mhm
of your loving arms
like i dont really know what im doing
harder baby harder baby harder baby
i must've called a thousand times
its been there for days on end and
that's why i can't love you in the dark
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
in case it is the last time
ill be home soon i wont be late
but loving you was a breakthrough
for the very first time
say it aint so say it aint so
'cause what if i never love again
'cause my baby's sweet as can be
at skyfall
i felt the branches of it looking at me
i can take a lot
waiting for a surprise
when will i see you again
at least that id know that youre okay
fed up of biding your time
but i found a boy who i love more
in every face that i've ever known
when im struggling to feel at all
i ain't lost just wandering
if youre ready if youre ready
and ignore the right
but it don't matter it clearly
what if i lose my heart & fail the 
skyfall is where we start
learning to fly learning to run
i dont wanna be cruel or vicious
your teasing aint enough
these final hours
as much as it did then
blew me away
darling this is goodbye
you and me together nothing gets better
it's like a ride that i want to get off
always make a mess of everything
just hold on
looks like i was wrong
think well never match at all
to scratch my itch & beat my drum
if i tell the world
i love your dad cause he gave you to me
who want to be right as rain
so i can finish what has begun
you know ill always mean
favoritism aint my thing but 
right here right now
our hearts break and hearts wait
havent made
don't patronize me
why am i obsessing
the reason you loved me before
where you go i go
god only knows why it's taken me 
so i can show you that i was wrong
wait do you see my heart on my sleeve
maybe were already defeated
and its bringing me out the dark
you're the right kind of madness
i've imagined it all
what are you waiting for
'cause there's a side to you
if the lord don't forgive me
every word i've said
youre gonna wish you never had met me
if i am i'm crazy for you
whenever im standing my own ground
hello can you hear me
stop trying to be somebody else
your love it is my truth
so tell me when youre gonna let me in
mmh yeah
until the end starts
is exactly what it seems
even now when we're already over
id settle for a busy tone
with you & me setting the tone
though i do know how you play
a thousand miles and poles apart
i know some clothes you left behind
and i was burnin' up a fever
you think we would and we do 
when my time comes around
it all it all it all
love you
a couple more til i forget your name
when will you run with me
and make me crazy for you
i dont know and i feel 
so i wont go i cant do it on his own
and she put her love down soft and sweet
and the whole world
that i call home
you say boo ive known you longer my dear
im a fool but they all think im blind
let me stay here for just one more night
dont need to look no further
i will leave my heart at the door
don't forget me i beg
forgive me first love but i'm tired
and id go crawling down the avenue
nobody told me that you'd be here
and its been that way to long
so overdue i owe them
cause we are living worlds apart
that the both of us
that corrupt our hearts somehow
for breaking your heart
lo passo mai insieme ate
it's a vision complete illusion yeah
you said im stubborn and i never give in
cause he wont go
i cant keep up with your turning tables
e'una vita che cercando a te
by putting ideas in our heads
like a joke or a memory
ye that's it baby
its about time that i face myself
i beg i'll remember you say
i can't do it on my own
i'd go hungry i'd go black and blue
from the moment
about what my hands and my body done
see when hard work dont pay off
our love ain't water under the bridge
no you wont
and kiss me back to life to see
but i won't go i can't do it on my own
when you don't yeah
and fall
im my own worst enemy
and im gonna make your head burn
i wont rise until this battles won
i want your heaven and your ocean's too
to self inflict that pain
with the world that you feel leave
was all in place
to give up this fight
i will change if i must
treat me soft but touch me cool
strangers by nature
a warm embrace
i see your eyes widen like an ocean
they don't know you like i do
my skins paper thin i cant stop wavering
but he stays all the same
feel the earth move and then
yeah thats it honey
its so cold in your wilderness
i love you a million percent
when the pain cuts you deep
then i went on home to my skyscrapers
dropped you off at the train station
whered you go when you stayed behind
is the subject of their talk
you know i you know im gonna do it
my god this reminds me
id go hungry
i wish youd come over
'cause i knew that that was 
i wont let you close enough to hurt me
for a million years
'cause who wants to be right as rain
it's been waiting for you to open up
i'll be somebody different
don't patronize
just hold me close don't patronize
or hide from the light
im going back to where i started
out i'm still trying to stay inside
but i swear i thought i dreamed her
i don't care how deep or shallow yeah
oh oh oh
i was too strong you were trembling
painting pictures
but i would never
we were born and raised
that i never knew never knew
i didn't care much how long i lived
and im sure my eyes they speak for me
when i wake up i'm afraid 
i'm a fool but they all think i'm blind
and even in the dark
so little to say but so much time
though your kisses
take it all with my love
now that its over
just take it take it all to you
thats why i cant love you in the dark
ill be better for you
consistency is the gift to give for free
with no chance to win
so why dont we just play pretend
and though i wish that you were here
