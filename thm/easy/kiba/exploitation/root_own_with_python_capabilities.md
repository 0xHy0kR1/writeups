## Binaries Capabilities
Binaries can have capabilities that can be used while executing. For example, it's very common to find `ping` binary with `cap_net_raw` capability:
```python
getcap /usr/bin/ping
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
```

**You can search binaries with capabilities using:**
```python
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```
In the context of Linux systems, "capabilities" refer to a set of fine-grained permissions that can be granted to specific executable files. These capabilities allow a program to perform privileged operations without requiring full root (superuser) privileges.

We going to abuse binary capabilities to get a shell with root priviledges

### Finding the binaries with capabilities

we found python3 which can get us to root

**Using python3 letâ€™s import the module os and set the id to 0 which makes us the root.**
