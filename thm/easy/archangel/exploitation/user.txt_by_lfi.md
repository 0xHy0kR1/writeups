The code that sanitizes the View property is checking for the presence of the `development_testing` directory and also making sure it does not contain the string `../..`.  In order to get around this, we can use the present directory syntax `./` in between our parent directory traversals.  So we no longer chain multiple `../`'s together.  This avoids the check and allows us to traverse up the directory tree.
