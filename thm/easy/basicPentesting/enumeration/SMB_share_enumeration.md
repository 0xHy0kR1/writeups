Here we need to find the username and password. But first we need to determine the users present on our target system.

So we know that samba is running on our target (from Nmap results & text files on the websites)  
We can use **enum4linux** tool to enumerate the machine. 
**Syntax for tool is as follows :**
```python
enum4linux -e [Target_Machine_IP]
```

**We get our users here :**
![[basicPen6.png]]
**Jan** and **Kay**  
or we can say that in our texts _Jan is J_ and _Kay is K_
